My man page expirement for Virtual Box docs.
The pain with the VB man pages was knowing which page I needed.
So I generated each help page into a single file that I can open with vi.

Ctl -w (release)
  w cycle through windows left to right
  h left a window
  l right
  j down
  k up

Here's the awk command I used to generate the files:
vboxmanage |awk '/^[[:blank:]]+VBoxManage [[:alnum:]]/ {print $1, "--help", $2, ">", $2".man"}' |awk '!seen[$0]++' |zsh

The function to call this is
  function vbman() {
    vi -u ~/vbman/.vbmanrc ~/vbman/${1}.man
     }

The files are in vbman folder in my home dir.
I have a config file specific to this in .vbmanrc

  set expandtab
  set tabstop=2
  set shiftwidth=2

  " Word Wrap Stuff:
  "=================
  set linebreak
  set breakindent

  " NERDTree stuff
  " ==============
  " Start NERDTree and leave the cursor in opened file.
  autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree ~/vbman |wincmd p

  " Exit Vim if NERDTree is the only window remaining in the only tab.
  autocmd BufEnter * if tabpagenr('$') == 1 && winnr('$') == 1 && exists('b:NERDTree') && b:NERDTree.isTabTree() | call feedkeys(":quit\<CR>:\<BS>") | endif

  "hides ^G characters in the folder explorer column
  let g:NERDTreeNodeDelimiter = "\u00a0"
